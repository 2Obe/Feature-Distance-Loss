The original miniImageNet dataset has 100 classes. which are divided into 64 for training, 16 for validation and 20 for testing. 
However, in our experiments, we reconstruct the dataset to 100 classes, and each class has 600 images. 
400 samples per class are for training, 80 samples per class are for validation and 120 samples are for testing.
